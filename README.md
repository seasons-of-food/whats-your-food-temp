# Good Weather, Good Food, and Good Mood!

# Purpose

For this project, our goal was to give users weather data for a specific city along with a corresponding recipe depending on the temperature of their city and the current temperature. Users input a city name and select a mealtime of breakfast, lunch or dinner in order to see weather data and a recipe recommendation. 

We used a combination of 2 APIs for weather and recipe data, combined with javascript functions and a CSS framework called Foundation, to execute the code. Other elements involved in our coding process was the use of client-side storage, jQuery and error handling.
